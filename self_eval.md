# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of? Today was a tough one. Mentally discouraged but I know I have things to work on before Mod 1 and increase my understanding of defining an method to find a solution. 
- What is the power of using methods in our applications? Methods can be used many times once defined making work easier for developers to call on those methods.
